# Poker
Java server for an online poker project


Let's keep te readme.md file as a place to put the general to-dos.

I think the first version should just be a plain console-based version which runs on a single computer, but that allows to add 1-10 players. This will enable us to built out the following functionality:

- all the basic classes to run a poker game (card class, deck class, player class, game class)
- all the basic methods (deal card, shuffle deck, bet, fold)
- all the game logic (determining winners, determining side-pots, determining minbet / maxbet per player etc.)
- all the initial unit tests

perhaps the second version of the game would be using swing to create a GUI

once we have all of this, then we can see what it would take to build a java server. Maybe a way to build acconts, create a DB which keeps track of all hands that have been dealt, so we can replay hands. a login system etc.
